# 0.7.2

* Added variational autoencoder [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/unsupervised/variational/VariationalAutoEncoderExample.java)
* Activation function refactor
  * Activation functions are now an interface [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/master/nd4j/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/activations/IActivation.java)
  * Configuration now via enumeration, not via String (see examples - [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples))
  * Custom activation functions now supported [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/misc/activationfunctions/CustomActivationExample.java)
  * New activation functions added: hard sigmoid, randomized leaky rectified linear units (RReLU)
* Multiple fixes/improvements for Keras model import
* Added P-norm pooling for CNNs (option as part of SubsamplingLayer configuration)
* Iteration count persistence: stored/persisted properly in model configuration + fixes to learning rate schedules for Spark network training
* LSTM: gate activation function can now be configured (previously: hard-coded to sigmoid)
* UI:
  * Added Chinese translation
  * Fixes for UI + pretrain layers
  * Added Java 7 compatible stats collection compatibility [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/userInterface/UIStorageExample\_Java7.java)
  * Improvements in front-end for handling NaNs
  * Added UIServer.stop() method
  * Fixed score vs. iteration moving average line (with subsampling)
* Solved Jaxb/Jackson issue with Spring Boot based applications
* RecordReaderDataSetIterator now supports NDArrayWritable for the labels (set regression == true; used for multi-label classification + images, etc)

## 0.7.1 -> 0.7.2 Transition Notes

* Activation functions (built-in): now specified using Activation enumeration, not String (String-based configuration has been deprecated)
