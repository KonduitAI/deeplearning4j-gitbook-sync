## Deeplearning4J

### Deeplearning4J: New Features

* Added new SameDiff layers (automatic differentiation - only single class, forward pass definition required) to DL4J with full training support - SameDiffLayer, SameDiffVertex, SameDiffOutputLayer, SameDiffLambdaLayer, SameDiffLambdaVertex - note that these are CPU-only execution for now [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples/tree/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/samediff) [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/tree/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/layers/samediff) [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/5730)

Note that it is also possible to set a different base location for downloads (for local mirrors of DL4J resources) [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/5315)
* Added Out-of-memory (OOM) crash dump reporting functionality. Provides a dump with memory use and configuration if training/inference OOMs. Same information is available (without a crash) for MultiLayerNetwork/ComputationGraph.memoryInfo methods. Can be disabled (or output directory set) using [system properties](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-common/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/config/DL4JSystemProperties.java) - [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/util/CrashReportingUtil.java)

* Spark evaluation: added evaluation method overloads that allow specifying the number of evaluation workers (less than number of Spark threads) [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/5904)
* CnnSentenceDataSetIterator now has a Format argument, and supports outputting data for RNNs and 1D CNNs [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nlp-parent/deeplearning4j-nlp/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/iterator/CnnSentenceDataSetIterator.java#L68-L76)
* Added `ComputationGraph/MultiLayerNetwork.pretrain((Multi)DataSetIterator, int epochs)` method overloads [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/5947)
* MultiLayerNetwork and ComputationGraph now have `output` method overloads where the network output can be placed in the user-specified workspace, instead of being detached [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/5932) [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/graph/ComputationGraph.java#L1632-L1647).

### Deeplearning4J: API Changes (Transition Guide): 1.0.0-beta to 1.0.0-beta2

* GravesLSTM has been deprecated in favor of LSTM due to lack of CuDNN support but otherwise similar accuracy to in practice. Use LSTM class instead.
* deeplearning4j-modelexport-solr: now uses Lucene/Solr version 7.4.0 (was 7.3.0) [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/5744)
* Mask arrays for CNN2d layers must be in broadcastable 4d format: `[minibatch,depth or 1, height or 1, width or 1]` - previously they were 2d with shape `[minibatch,height]` or `[minibatch,width]`. This provents ambiguity in later cases (pooling layers), and allows for more complex masking scenarios (such as masking for different image sizes in same minibatch). [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/5942)
* Some older/deprecated Model and Layer methods have been removed. (validateInput(), initParams()). Some custom layers may need to be updated as a result [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/5954)

### Deelpearning4J: 1.0.0-beta2 Known Issues

* Windows users are unable to load the HDF5 files used in SvhnLabelProvider (used in HouseNumberDetection example). Linux/Mac users are unaffected. A workaround for windows users is to add the sonatype snapshot dependency `org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets:hdf5-platform:jar:1.10.2-1.4.3-SNAPSHOT` [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/6017)

* Workspaces can now be disabled globally, ignoring workspace configuration. This is mainly used for debugging; use `Nd4j.getWorkspaceManager().setDebugMode(DebugMode.DISABLED)` or `Nd4j.getWorkspaceManager().setDebugMode(DebugMode.SPILL_EVERYTHING);` to enable this.
