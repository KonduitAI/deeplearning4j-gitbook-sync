# 1.0.0-M1.1

## Highlights

A number of bug fixes following the M1 release, thanks to the feedback from the community, allowed us to quickly sort out a few issues. This is a minor bug fix release to address short comings found with M1. Most fixes were related to keras import, the cnn/rnn helpers, and python4j.

Snapshots will also be published every 2 days automatically now [https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/9355](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/9355) to get around sonatype ossrh deletion of snapshots every 3 days. This should increase robustness of the snapshots.

Worked around an issue with github actions pre emptively upgrading visual studio breaking the cuda builds: [https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/9364](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/9364)

Added backwards compatibility for centos 6 via a new linux-x86\_64-compat classifier enabling use of older glibcs on centos 7:

A number of bugs were fixed with LSTM and CUDNN: [https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/9372](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/9372)

### Known issues

[https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/9142](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/9142) - avoid shuffle operations on gpu. Pre save data on cpu in mini batches. For more help, please post on the forums at https://community.konduit.ai/
