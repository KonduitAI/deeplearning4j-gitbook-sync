# 1.0.0-beta4

## Highlights - 1.0.0-beta4 Release

**Main highlight: full multi-datatype support for ND4J and DL4J.** In past releases, all N-Dimensional arrays in ND4J were limited to a single datatype (float or double), set globally. Now, arrays of all datatypes may be used simultaneously. The following [datatypes](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/master/nd4j/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/api/buffer/DataType.java) are supported:

* DOUBLE: double precision floating point, 64-bit (8 byte)
* FLOAT: single precision floating point, 32-bit (4 byte)
* HALF: half precision floating point, 16-bit (2 byte), "FP16"
* LONG: long signed integer, 64 bit (8 byte)
* INT: signed integer, 32 bit (4 byte)
* SHORT: signed short integer, 16 bit (2 byte)
* UBYTE: unsigned byte, 8 bit (1 byte), 0 to 255
* BYTE: signed byte, 8 bit (1 byte), -128 to 127
* BOOL: boolean type, (0/1, true/false). Uses ubyte storage for easier op parallelization
* UTF8: String array type, UTF8 format

_ND4J Behaviour changes of note:_

* When creating an INDArray from a Java primitive array, the INDArray datatype will be determined by the primitive array type (unless a datatype is specified)
  * For example: Nd4j.createFromArray(double\[]) -> DOUBLE datatype INDArray
  * Similarly, Nd4j.scalar(1), Nd4j.scalar(1L), Nd4j.scalar(1.0) and Nd4j.scalar(1.0f) will produce INT, LONG, DOUBLE and FLOAT type scalar INDArrays respectively
* Some operations require matched datatypes for operands
  * For example, if x and y are different datatypes, a cast may be required: x.add(y.castTo(x.dataType()))
* Some operations have datatype restrictions: for example, sum on a UTF8 array is not supported, nor is variance on a BOOL array. For some operations on boolean arrays (such as sum), casting to an integer or floating point type first may make sense.

_DL4J Behaviour changes of note:_

* MultiLayerNetwork/ComputationGraph no longer depend in any way on ND4J global datatype.
  * The datatype of a network (DataType for it's parameters and activations) can be set during construction using `NeuralNetConfigutation.Builder().dataType(DataType)`
  * Networks can be converted from one type to another (double to float, float to half etc) using `MultiLayerNetwork/ComputationGraph.convertDataType(DataType)` method

_Main new methods:_

* Nd4j.create(), zeros(), ones(), linspace(), etc methods with DataType argument
* INDArray.castTo(DataType) method - to convert INDArrays from one datatype to another
* New Nd4j.createFromArray(...) methods for

**ND4J/DL4J: CUDA - 10.1 support added, CUDA 9.0 support dropped**

CUDA versions supported in 1.0.0-beta4: CUDA 9.2, 10.0, 10.1.

**ND4J: Mac/OSX CUDA support dropped**

Mac (OSX) CUDA binaries are no longer provided. Linux (x86\_64, ppc64le) and Windows (x86\_64) CUDA support remains. OSX CPU support (x86\_64) is still available.

**DL4J/ND4J: MKL-DNN Support Added** DL4J (and ND4J conv2d etc ops) now support MKL-DNN by default when running on CPU/native backend. MKL-DNN support is implemented for the following layer types:

* ConvolutionLayer and Convolution1DLayer (and Conv2D/Conv2DDerivative ND4J ops)
* SubsamplingLayer and Subsampling1DLayer (and MaxPooling2D/AvgPooling2D/Pooling2DDerivative ND4J ops)
* BatchNormalization layer (and BatchNorm ND4J op)
* LocalResponseNormalization layer (and LocalResponseNormalization ND4J op)
* Convolution3D layer (and Conv3D/Conv3DDerivative ND4J ops)

MKL-DNN support for other layer types (such as LSTM) will be added in a future release.

MKL-DNN can be disabled globally (ND4J and DL4J) using `Nd4jCpu.Environment.getInstance().setUseMKLDNN(false);`

MKL-DNN can be disabled globally for specific ops by setting `ND4J_MKL_FALLBACK` environment variable to the name of the operations to have MKL-DNN support disabled for. For example: `ND4J_MKL_FALLBACK=conv2d,conv2d_bp`

**ND4J: Improved Performance due to Memory Management Changes**

Prior releases of ND4J used periodic garbage collection (GC) to release memory that was not allocated in a memory workspace. (Note that DL4J uses workspaces for almost all operations by default hence periodic GC could frequently be disabled when training DL4J networks). However, the reliance on garbage collection resulted in a performance overhead that scaled with the number of objects in the JVM heap.

In 1.0.0-beta4, the periodic garbage collection is disabled by default; instead, GC will be called only when it is required to reclaim memory from arrays that are allocated outside of workspaces.

To re-enable periodic GC (as per the default in beta3) and set the GC frequency to every 5 seconds (5000ms) you can use:

```
Nd4j.getMemoryManager().togglePeriodicGc(true);
Nd4j.getMemoryManager().setAutoGcWindow(5000);
```

**ND4J: Improved Rank 0/1 Array Support**

In prior versions of ND4J, scalars and vectors would sometimes be rank 2 instead of rank 0/1 when getting rows/columns, getting sub-arrays using INDArray.get(NDArrayIndex...) or when creating arrays from Java arrays/scalars. Now, behaviour should be more consistent for these rank 0/1 cases. Note to maintain old behaviour for getRow and getColumn (i.e., return rank 2 array with shape \[1,x] and \[x,1] respectively), the `getRow(long,boolean)` and `getColumn(long,boolean)` methods can be used.

**DL4J: Attention layers added**

* [AttentionVertex](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/graph/AttentionVertex.java)

### ND4J: Known Issues

* Most CustomOperation operations (such as those used in SameDiff) are CPU only until next release. GPU support was not completed in time for 1.0.0-beta4 release.
* Some users with Intel Skylake CPUs have reported deadlocks on MKL-DNN convolution 2d backprop operations (DL4J ConvolutionLayer backprop, ND4J "conv2d\_bp" operation) when OMP\_NUM\_THREADS is set to 8 or higher. Investigations suggest this is likely an issue with MKL-DNN, not DL4J/ND4J. See [Issue 7637](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/7637). Workaround: Disable MKL-DNN for conv2d\_bp operation via ND4J\_MKL\_FALLBACK (see earlier) or disable MKL-DNN globally, for Skylake CPUs.
