### Deeplearning4J: API Changes (Transition Guide): 0.9.1 to 1.0.0-alpha

* Default training workspace mode has been switched to SEPARATE from NONE for MultiLayerNetwork and ComputationGraph ([Link](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-LsGrpMiOeoMSFYK0VJQ-714541269/config/config-memory/config-workspaces.md))
* Behaviour change: `fit(DataSetIterator)` and similar methods no longer perform layerwise pretraining followed by backprop - only backprop is performed in these methods. For pretraining, use `pretrain(DataSetIterator)` and `pretrain(MultiDataSetIterator)` methods ([Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/4279))
* Previously deprecated updater configuration methods (`.learningRate(double)`, `.momentum(double)` etc) all removed
  * To configure learning rate: use `.updater(new Adam(lr))` instead of `.updater(Updater.ADAM).learningRate(lr)`
  * To configure bias learning rate: use `.biasUpdater(IUpdater)` method
  * To configure learning rate schedules: use `.updater(new Adam(ISchedule))` and similar
* Updater configuration via enumeration (i.e., `.updater(Updater)`) has been deprecated; use `.updater(IUpdater)`
* `.regularization(boolean)` config removed; functionality is now always equivalent to `.regularization(true)`
* `.useDropConnect(boolean)` removed; use `.weightNoise(new DropConnect(double))` instead
* `.iterations(int)` method has been removed (was rarely used and confusing to users)
* Multiple utility classes (in `org.deeplearning4j.util`) have been deprecated and/or moved to nd4j-common. Use same class names in nd4j-common `org.nd4j.util` instead.
* DataSetIterators in DL4J have been moved from deeplearning4j-nn module to new deeplearning4j-datasets, deeplearning4j-datavec-iterators and deeplearning4j-utility-iterators modules. Packages/imports are unchanged; deeplearning4j-core pulls these in as transitive dependencies hence no user changes should be required in most cases ([Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/4855))
* Previously deprecated `.activation(String)` has been removed; use `.activation(Activation)` or `.activation(IActivation)` instead
* Layer API change: Custom layers may need to implement `applyConstraints(int iteration, int epoch)` method
* Parameter initializer API change: Custom parameter initializers may need to implement `isWeightParam(String)` and `isBiasParam(String)` methods
* RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine) layers have been removed entirely. Consider using VariationalAutoencoder layers as a replacement ([Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/layers/variational/VariationalAutoencoder.java))
* GravesBidirectionalLSTM has been deprecated; use `new Bidirectional(Bidirectional.Mode.ADD, new GravesLSTM.Builder()....build()))` instead
* Previously deprecated WordVectorSerializer methods have now been removed ([Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/4359))
* Removed deeplearning4j-ui-remote-iterationlisteners module and obsolete RemoteConvolutionalIterationListener ([Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/4772))

### Deeplearning4J: 1.0.0-alpha Known Issues

* Performance on some networks types may be reduced on CUDA compared to 0.9.1 (with workspaces configured). This will be addressed in the next release
* Some issues have been noted with FP16 support on CUDA ([Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/4897))

## Deeplearing4J: Keras Import

* Keras 2 support, keeping backward compatibility for keras 1

### Deeplearning4J: Keras Import - API Changes (Transition Guide): 0.9.1 to 1.0.0-alpha

* In 0.9.1 deprecated `Model` and `ModelConfiguration` have been permanently removed. Use [KerasModelImport](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-modelimport/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/modelimport/keras/KerasModelImport.java) instead, which is now the only entry point for Keras model import.

### Deeplearning4J: Keras Import - Known Issues

* Embedding layer: In DL4J the output of an embedding layer is 2D by default, unless preprocessors are specified. In Keras the output is always 3D, but depending on specified parameters can be interpreted as 2D. This often leads to difficulties when importing Embedding layers. Many cases have been covered and issues fixed, but inconsistencies remain.
* Batchnormalization layer: DL4J's batch normalization layer is much more restrictive (in a good way) than Keras' version of it. For instance, DL4J only allows to normalize spatial dimensions for 4D convolutional inputs, while in Keras any axis can be used for normalization. Depending on the dimension ordering (NCHW vs. NHWC) and the specific configuration used by a Keras user, this can lead to expected (!) and unexpected import errors.
* Support for importing a Keras model for training purposes in DL4J (enforceTrainingConfig == true) is still very limited and will be tackled properly for the next release.
* Keras Merge layers: seem to work fine with the Keras functional API, but have issues when used in a Sequential model.
* Reshape layers: can be somewhat unreliable on import. DL4J rarely has a need to explicitly reshape input beyond (inferred) standard input preprocessors. In Keras, Reshape layers are used quite often. Mapping the two paradigms can be difficult in edge cases.

## ND4J

### ND4J: New Features

* Hundreds of new operations added
* New DifferentialFunction api with automatic differentiation (see samediff section) [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/tree/master/nd4j/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/autodiff/samediff)

* nVidia CUDA 8/9.0/9.1 now supported
* Worskpaces improvements were introduced to ensure safety: SCOPE\_PANIC profiling mode is enabled by default
* FlatBuffers support for INDArray serde
* Support for auto-broadcastable operations was added
* libnd4j, underlying c++ library, got functionality boost and now offers: NDArray class, Graph class, and can be used as standalone library or executable.
* Convolution-related ops now support NHWC in addition to NCHW data format.
* Accumulation ops now have option to keep reduced dimensions.

### ND4J: Known Issues

* Not all op gradients implemented for automatic differentiation
* Vast majority of new operations added in 1.0.0-alpha do NOT use GPU yet.

### ND4J: API Changes (Transition Guide): 0.9.1 to 1.0.0-alpha

## ND4J - SameDiff

* Initial tech preview [Link](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/tree/master/nd4j/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/autodiff/samediff)
* Control flow is supported with IF and WHILE primitives.

Alpha release of [SameDiff](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/tree/master/nd4j/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/autodiff) auto-differentiation engine for ND4J.

### Features

* Two execution modes available: Java-driven execution, and Native execution for serialized graphs.
* SameDiff graphs can be serialized using FlatBuffers
* Building and running computation graphs build from SameDiff operations.
* Graphs can run forward pass on input data and compute gradients for the backward pass.
* Already supports many high-level layers, like dense layers, convolutions (1D-3D) deconvolutions, separable convolutions, pooling and upsampling, batch normalization, local response normalization, LSTMs and GRUs.
* In total there are about 350 SameDiff operations available, including many basic operations used in building complex graphs.
* Supports rudimentary import of [TensorFlow](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/tree/d4a15e394ef81592237677aee932eb734d64f5a7/nd4j-backends/nd4j-tests/src/test/java/org/nd4j/imports) and ONNX graphs for inference.
* [TFOpTests](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/TFOpTests) is a dedicated project for creating test resources for TensorFlow import.

### Known Issues and Limitations

* Vast majority of new operations added in 1.0.0-alpha do NOT use GPU yet.
* While many of the widely used base operations and high-level layers used in practice are supported, op coverage is still limited. Goal is to achieve feature parity with TensorFlow and fully support import for TF graphs.
* Some of the existing ops do not have a backward pass implemented (called `doDiff` in SameDiff).
