# Saving and Loading Models

MultiLayerNetwork and ComputationGraph both have save and load methods.

You can save/load a MultiLayerNetwork using:

```java
MultiLayerNetwork net = ...
net.save(new File("...");

MultiLayerNetwork net2 = MultiLayerNetwork.load(new File("..."), true);
```

Similarly, you can save/load a ComputationGraph using:

```java
ComputationGraph net = ...
net.save(new File("..."));

ComputationGraph net2 = ComputationGraph.load(new File("..."), true);
```

Internally, these methods use the `ModelSerializer` class, which handles loading and saving models. There are two methods for saving models shown in the examples through the link. The first example saves a normal multi layer network, the second one saves a [computation graph](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-LsGrpMiOeoMSFYK0VJQ-714541269/deeplearning4j/reference/computationgraph.md).

Here is a [basic example](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples/tree/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/misc/modelsaving) with code to save a computation graph using the `ModelSerializer` class, as well as an example of using ModelSerializer to save a neural net built using MultiLayer configuration.

## RNG Seed

If your model uses probabilities (i.e. DropOut/DropConnect), it may make sense to save it separately, and apply it after model is restored; i.e:

```java
 Nd4j.getRandom().setSeed(12345);
 ModelSerializer.restoreMultiLayerNetwork(modelFile);
```

This will guarantee equal results between sessions/JVMs.
