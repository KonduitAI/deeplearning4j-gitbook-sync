# Constraints

All [Keras constraints](https://keras.io/constraints) are supported:

* max\_norm
* non\_neg
* unit\_norm
* min\_max\_norm

Mapping Keras to DL4J constraints happens in [KerasConstraintUtils](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-modelimport/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/modelimport/keras/utils/KerasConstraintUtils.java).
