# Regularizers

All \[Keras regularizers] are supported by DL4J model import:

* l1
* l2
* l1\_l2

Mapping of regularizers can be found in [KerasRegularizerUtils](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-modelimport/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/modelimport/keras/utils/KerasRegularizerUtils.java).
