# Spark API Reference

## SharedTrainingMaster

[\[source\]](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/tree/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-scaleout/spark/dl4j-spark-parameterserver/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/spark/parameterserver/training/SharedTrainingMaster.java)

SharedTrainingMaster implements distributed training of neural networks using a compressed quantized gradient (update) sharing implementation based on the Strom 2015 paper “Scalable Distributed DNN Training Using Commodity GPU Cloud Computing”: [https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon.jobs-public-documents/strom\_interspeech2015.pdf](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon.jobs-public-documents/strom\_interspeech2015.pdf). The Deeplearning4j implementation makes a number of modifications, such as having the option to use a parameter-server based implementation for fault tolerance and execution where multicast networking support is not available.

**fromJson**

```java
public static SharedTrainingMaster fromJson(String jsonStr)
```

Create a SharedTrainingMaster instance by deserializing a JSON string that has been serialized with {- link #toJson()}

* param jsonStr SharedTrainingMaster configuration serialized as JSON

**fromYaml**

```java
public static SharedTrainingMaster fromYaml(String yamlStr)
```

Create a SharedTrainingMaster instance by deserializing a YAML string that has been serialized with {- link #toYaml()}

* param yamlStr SharedTrainingMaster configuration serialized as YAML

**collectTrainingStats**

```java
public Builder collectTrainingStats(boolean enable)
```

Create a SharedTrainingMaster with defaults other than the RDD number of examples

* param rddDataSetNumExamples When fitting from an {- code RDD} how many examples are in each dataset?

**repartitionData**

```java
public Builder repartitionData(Repartition repartition)
```

This parameter defines when repartition is applied (if applied).

* param repartition Repartition setting
* deprecated Use {- link #repartitioner(Repartitioner)}

**repartitionStrategy**

```java
public Builder repartitionStrategy(RepartitionStrategy repartitionStrategy)
```

Used in conjunction with {- link #repartitionData(Repartition)} (which defines when repartitioning should be conducted), repartitionStrategy defines how the repartitioning should be done. See {- link RepartitionStrategy} for details

* param repartitionStrategy Repartitioning strategy to use
* deprecated Use {- link #repartitioner(Repartitioner)}

**storageLevel**

```java
public Builder storageLevel(StorageLevel storageLevel)
```

Set the storage level for {- code RDD}s.\
Default: StorageLevel.MEMORY\_ONLY\_SER() - i.e., store in memory, in serialized form\
To use no RDD persistence, use {- code null}\
Note that this only has effect when {- code RDDTrainingApproach.Direct} is used (which is not the default), and when fitting from an {- code RDD}.

**Note**: Spark’s StorageLevel.MEMORY\_ONLY() and StorageLevel.MEMORY\_AND\_DISK() can be problematic when it comes to off-heap data (which DL4J/ND4J uses extensively). Spark does not account for off-heap memory when deciding if/when to drop blocks to ensure enough free memory; consequently, for DataSet RDDs that are larger than the total amount of (off-heap) memory, this can lead to OOM issues. Put another way: Spark counts the on-heap size of DataSet and INDArray objects only (which is negligible) resulting in a significant underestimate of the true DataSet object sizes. More DataSets are thus kept in memory than we can really afford.

Note also that fitting directly from an {- code RDD} is discouraged - it is better to export your prepared data once and call (for example} {- code SparkDl4jMultiLayer.fit(String savedDataDirectory)}. See DL4J's Spark website documentation for details.

* param storageLevel Storage level to use for DataSet RDDs

**rddTrainingApproach**

```java
public Builder rddTrainingApproach(RDDTrainingApproach rddTrainingApproach)
```

The approach to use when training on a {- code RDD} or {- code RDD}. Default: {- link RDDTrainingApproach#Export}, which exports data to a temporary directory first.\
The default cluster temporary directory is used, though can be configured using {- link #exportDirectory(String)} Note also that fitting directly from an {- code RDD} is discouraged - it is better to export your prepared data once and call (for example} {- code SparkDl4jMultiLayer.fit(String savedDataDirectory)}. See DL4J's Spark website documentation for details.

* param rddTrainingApproach Training approach to use when training from a {- code RDD} or {- code RDD}

**exportDirectory**

```java
public Builder exportDirectory(String exportDirectory)
```

When {- link #rddTrainingApproach(RDDTrainingApproach)} is set to {- link RDDTrainingApproach#Export} (as it is by default) the data is exported to a temporary directory first.

Default: null. -> use {hadoop.tmp.dir}/dl4j/. In this case, data is exported to {hadoop.tmp.dir}/dl4j/SOME\_UNIQUE\_ID/\
If you specify a directory, the directory {exportDirectory}/SOME\_UNIQUE\_ID/ will be used instead.

* param exportDirectory Base directory to export data

**rngSeed**

```java
public Builder rngSeed(long rngSeed)
```

Random number generator seed, used mainly for enforcing repeatable splitting/repartitioning on RDDs Default: no seed set (i.e., random seed)

* param rngSeed RNG seed

**updatesThreshold**

```java
public Builder updatesThreshold(double updatesThreshold)
```

* deprecated Use {- link #thresholdAlgorithm(ThresholdAlgorithm)} with (for example) {- link AdaptiveThresholdAlgorithm}

**thresholdAlgorithm**

```java
public Builder thresholdAlgorithm(ThresholdAlgorithm thresholdAlgorithm)
```

Algorithm to use to determine the threshold for updates encoding. Lower values might improve convergence, but increase amount of network communication\
Values that are too low may also impact network convergence. If convergence problems are observed, try increasing or decreasing this by a factor of 10 - say 1e-4 and 1e-2.\
For technical details, see the paper [Scalable Distributed DNN Training Using Commodity GPU Cloud Computing](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon.jobs-public-documents/strom\_interspeech2015.pdf)\
See also {- link ThresholdAlgorithm}

Default: {- link AdaptiveThresholdAlgorithm} with default parameters

* param thresholdAlgorithm Threshold algorithm to use to determine encoding threshold

**residualPostProcessor**

```java
public Builder residualPostProcessor(ResidualPostProcessor residualPostProcessor)
```

Residual post processor. See {- link ResidualPostProcessor} for details.

Default: {- code new ResidualClippingPostProcessor(5.0, 5)} - i.e., a {- link ResidualClippingPostProcessor} that clips the residual to +/- 5x current threshold, every 5 iterations.

* param residualPostProcessor Residual post processor to use

**batchSizePerWorker**

```java
public Builder batchSizePerWorker(int batchSize)
```

Minibatch size to use when training workers. In principle, the source data (i.e., {- code RDD} etc) can have a different number of examples in each {- code DataSet} than we want to use when training. i.e., we can split or combine DataSets if required.

* param batchSize Minibatch size to use when fitting each worker

**workersPerNode**

```java
public Builder workersPerNode(int numWorkers)
```

This method allows to configure number of network training threads per cluster node.\
Default value: -1, which defines automated number of workers selection, based on hardware present in system (i.e., number of GPUs, if training on a GPU enabled system).\
When training on GPUs, you should use 1 worker per GPU (which is the default). For CPUs, 1 worker per node is usually preferred, though multi-CPU (i.e., multiple physical CPUs) or CPUs with large core counts may have better throughput (i.e., more examples per second) when increasing the number of workers, at the expense of more memory consumed. Note that if you increase the number of workers on a CPU system, you should set the number of OpenMP threads using the {- code OMP\_NUM\_THREADS} property - see {- link org.nd4j.config.ND4JEnvironmentVars#OMP\_NUM\_THREADS} for more details. For example, a machine with 32 physical cores could use 4 workers with {- code OMP\_NUM\_THREADS=8}

* param numWorkers Number of workers on each node.

**debugLongerIterations**

```java
public Builder debugLongerIterations(long timeMs)
```

This method allows you to artificially extend iteration time using Thread.sleep() for a given time.

PLEASE NOTE: Never use that option in production environment. It’s suited for debugging purposes only.

* param timeMs
* return

**transport**

```java
public Builder transport(Transport transport)
```

Optional method: Transport implementation to be used as TransportType.CUSTOM for VoidParameterAveraging method\
Generally not used by users

* param transport Transport to use
* return

**workerPrefetchNumBatches**

```java
public Builder workerPrefetchNumBatches(int prefetchNumBatches)
```

Number of minibatches to asynchronously prefetch on each worker when training. Default: 2, which is usually suitable in most cases. Increasing this might help in some cases of ETL (data loading) bottlenecks, at the expense of greater memory consumption

* param prefetchNumBatches Number of batches to prefetch

**repartitioner**

```java
public Builder repartitioner(Repartitioner repartitioner)
```

Repartitioner to use to repartition data before fitting.\
DL4J performs a MapPartitions operation for training, hence how the data is partitioned can matter a lot for performance - too few partitions (or very imbalanced partitions can result in poor cluster utilization, due to some workers being idle. A larger number of smaller partitions can help to avoid so-called “end-of-epoch” effects where training can only complete once the last/slowest worker finishes it’s partition.\
Default repartitioner is {- link DefaultRepartitioner}, which repartitions equally up to a maximum of 5000 partitions, and is usually suitable for most purposes. In the worst case, the “end of epoch” effect when using the partitioner should be limited to a maximum of the amount of time required to process a single partition.

* param repartitioner Repartitioner to use

**workerTogglePeriodicGC**

```java
public Builder workerTogglePeriodicGC(boolean workerTogglePeriodicGC)
```

Used to disable the periodic garbage collection calls on the workers.\
Equivalent to {- code Nd4j.getMemoryManager().togglePeriodicGc(workerTogglePeriodicGC);}\
Pass false to disable periodic GC on the workers or true (equivalent to the default, or not setting it) to keep it enabled.

* param workerTogglePeriodicGC Worker periodic garbage collection setting

**workerPeriodicGCFrequency**

```java
public Builder workerPeriodicGCFrequency(int workerPeriodicGCFrequency)
```

Used to set the periodic garbage collection frequency on the workers.\
Equivalent to calling {- code Nd4j.getMemoryManager().setAutoGcWindow(workerPeriodicGCFrequency);} on each worker\
Does not have any effect if {- link #workerTogglePeriodicGC(boolean)} is set to false

* param workerPeriodicGCFrequency The periodic GC frequency to use on the workers

**encodingDebugMode**

```java
public Builder encodingDebugMode(boolean enabled)
```

Enable debug mode for threshold encoding. When enabled, various statistics for the threshold and the residual will be calculated and logged on each worker (at info log level).\
This information can be used to check if the encoding threshold is too big (for example, virtually all updates are much smaller than the threshold) or too big (majority of updates are much larger than the threshold).\
encodingDebugMode is disabled by default.\
**IMPORTANT**: enabling this has a performance overhead, and should not be enabled unless the debug information is actually required.

* param enabled True to enable

## SparkComputationGraph

[\[source\]](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/tree/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-scaleout/spark/dl4j-spark/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/spark/impl/graph/SparkComputationGraph.java)

public Builder trainingHooks(Collection<TrainingHook> trainingHooks)
```

Adds training hooks to the master. The training master will setup the workers with the desired hooks for training. This can allow for tings like parameter servers and async updates as well as collecting statistics.

* param trainingHooks the training hooks to ad
* return

**trainingHooks**

```java
public Builder trainingHooks(TrainingHook... hooks)
```

Adds training hooks to the master. The training master will setup the workers with the desired hooks for training. This can allow for tings like parameter servers and async updates as well as collecting statistics.

* param hooks the training hooks to ad
* return

**batchSizePerWorker**

```java
public Builder batchSizePerWorker(int batchSizePerWorker)
```

Same as {- link #Builder(Integer, int)} but automatically set number of workers based on JavaSparkContext.defaultParallelism()

* param rddDataSetNumExamples Number of examples in each DataSet object in the {- code RDD}

**averagingFrequency**

```java
public Builder averagingFrequency(int averagingFrequency)
```

Frequency with which to average worker parameters.\
**Note**: Too high or too low can be bad for different reasons.

* Too low (such as 1) can result in a lot of network traffic&#x20;
* Too high (» 20 or so) can result in accuracy issues or problems with network convergence
* param averagingFrequency Frequency (in number of minibatches of size ‘batchSizePerWorker’) to average parameters

**aggregationDepth**

```java
public Builder aggregationDepth(int aggregationDepth)
```

The number of levels in the aggregation tree for parameter synchronization. (default: 2) **Note**: For large models trained with many partitions, increasing this number will reduce the load on the driver and help prevent it from becoming a bottleneck.

* param aggregationDepth RDD tree aggregation channels when averaging parameter updates.

**workerPrefetchNumBatches**

```java
public Builder workerPrefetchNumBatches(int prefetchNumBatches)
```

Set the number of minibatches to asynchronously prefetch in the worker.

Default: 0 (no prefetching)

* param prefetchNumBatches Number of minibatches (DataSets of size batchSizePerWorker) to fetch

**saveUpdater**

```java
public Builder saveUpdater(boolean saveUpdater)
```

Set whether the updater (i.e., historical state for momentum, adagrad, etc should be saved). **NOTE**: This can **double** (or more) the amount of network traffic in each direction, but might improve network training performance (and can be more stable for certain updaters such as adagrad).

This is **enabled** by default.

* param saveUpdater If true: retain the updater state (default). If false, don’t retain (updaters will be reinitalized in each worker after averaging).

**repartionData**

```java
public Builder repartionData(Repartition repartition)
```

Set if/when repartitioning should be conducted for the training data.\
Default value: always repartition (if required to guarantee correct number of partitions and correct number of examples in each partition).

* param repartition Setting for repartitioning

**repartitionStrategy**

```java
public Builder repartitionStrategy(RepartitionStrategy repartitionStrategy)
```

Used in conjunction with {- link #repartionData(Repartition)} (which defines when repartitioning should be conducted), repartitionStrategy defines how the repartitioning should be done. See {- link RepartitionStrategy} for details

* param repartitionStrategy Repartitioning strategy to use

**storageLevel**

```java
public Builder storageLevel(StorageLevel storageLevel)
```

Set the storage level for {- code RDD}s.\
Default: StorageLevel.MEMORY\_ONLY\_SER() - i.e., store in memory, in serialized form\
To use no RDD persistence, use {- code null}

**Note**: Spark’s StorageLevel.MEMORY\_ONLY() and StorageLevel.MEMORY\_AND\_DISK() can be problematic when it comes to off-heap data (which DL4J/ND4J uses extensively). Spark does not account for off-heap memory when deciding if/when to drop blocks to ensure enough free memory; consequently, for DataSet RDDs that are larger than the total amount of (off-heap) memory, this can lead to OOM issues. Put another way: Spark counts the on-heap size of DataSet and INDArray objects only (which is negligible) resulting in a significant underestimate of the true DataSet object sizes. More DataSets are thus kept in memory than we can really afford.

* param storageLevel Storage level to use for DataSet RDDs

**storageLevelStreams**

```java
public Builder storageLevelStreams(StorageLevel storageLevelStreams)
```

Set the storage level RDDs used when fitting data from Streams: either PortableDataStreams (sc.binaryFiles via {- link SparkDl4jMultiLayer#fit(String)} and {- link SparkComputationGraph#fit(String)}) or String paths (via {- link SparkDl4jMultiLayer#fitPaths(JavaRDD)}, {- link SparkComputationGraph#fitPaths(JavaRDD)} and {- link SparkComputationGraph#fitPathsMultiDataSet(JavaRDD)}).

Default storage level is StorageLevel.MEMORY\_ONLY() which should be appropriate in most cases.

* param storageLevelStreams Storage level to use

**rddTrainingApproach**

```java
public Builder rddTrainingApproach(RDDTrainingApproach rddTrainingApproach)
```

The approach to use when training on a {- code RDD} or {- code RDD}. Default: {- link RDDTrainingApproach#Export}, which exports data to a temporary directory first

* param rddTrainingApproach Training approach to use when training from a {- code RDD} or {- code RDD}

**exportDirectory**

```java
public Builder exportDirectory(String exportDirectory)
```

When {- link #rddTrainingApproach(RDDTrainingApproach)} is set to {- link RDDTrainingApproach#Export} (as it is by default) the data is exported to a temporary directory first.

Default: null. -> use {hadoop.tmp.dir}/dl4j/. In this case, data is exported to {hadoop.tmp.dir}/dl4j/SOME\_UNIQUE\_ID/\
If you specify a directory, the directory {exportDirectory}/SOME\_UNIQUE\_ID/ will be used instead.

* param exportDirectory Base directory to export data

**rngSeed**

```java
public Builder rngSeed(long rngSeed)
```

Random number generator seed, used mainly for enforcing repeatable splitting on RDDs Default: no seed set (i.e., random seed)

* param rngSeed RNG seed
* return

**collectTrainingStats**

```java
public Builder collectTrainingStats(boolean collectTrainingStats)
```

Whether training stats collection should be enabled (disabled by default).

* see ParameterAveragingTrainingMaster#setCollectTrainingStats(boolean)
* see org.deeplearning4j.spark.stats.StatsUtils#exportStatsAsHTML(SparkTrainingStats, OutputStream)
* param collectTrainingStats
